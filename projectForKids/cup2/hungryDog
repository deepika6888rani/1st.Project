The Story of The Greedy Dog
Once upon a time, there was a stray dog that lived on the streets. He was a glutton. He had to suffer a lot because of this habit. He would promise himself that he would not be greedy again each time. But he would quickly forget his pledge and become greedy as before.


One day, he was very hungry. So, he went to the opposite side of the bridge outside his house to look for food. He crossed the wooden bridge and began searching for food. Fortunately, he found a large bone, which he clutched securely in his teeth so that no other dog could eat it.


He was ready to chew the bone when he realised that if any of his buddies were to be there, he may have to share it with them. As a result, he decided to take the bone back to his house and eat it all by himself. He gazed into the water as he crossed the bridge and spotted another dog with a bone in his teeth.


He was greedy and wanted the second bone as well, so he yelled at the dog. The bone dropped into the water as he opened his lips to bark. It was then that he realised it wasn't another dog in the water, but his own reflection. Because of his greed, the dog lost bone and had to return home hungry. The greedy dog had been taught a lesson!
